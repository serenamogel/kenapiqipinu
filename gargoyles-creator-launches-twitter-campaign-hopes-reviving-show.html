This is exactly how the #YoungJustice fandom brought YJ back. It can happen to #Gargoyles too!”</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>He isn’t the only one who’s down for a reboot. Keith David has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">already expressed his willingness to return</a> if asked and it’s likely that his co-stars think the same way. Now, it’s all up to Disney+. If the demand is high enough, they’ll have no choice but to give the fans what they want. This means that those who want to see additonal episodes are going to have to keep pushing for more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1161c45e43e534d73de0d6bead20d004.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/dd6ddc0198da21fa028575541232784b.jpg><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>For those unfamiliar, Gargoyles revolves around beasts who are inadvertently awoken from a thousand-year slumber by a New York City billionaire. As they struggle to adapt to modern times, they befriend a cop named Eliza Maza who helps them fend off threats to both their existence and the world around them.</p><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>The show was unlike any other at Disney during that time. It featured a surprisingly&nbsp;dark tone, complex story arcs and Shakespearean themes that appealed to both kids and adults.&nbsp;Though the project only ran for three years, its success inspired a video game adaptation and several comic book series. Hopefully, “reboot” will be added to that list before too long.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false><strong>Gargoyles</strong> is currently available to stream on Disney+ in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yordGgprKklah6pL7Emquoql2hrra6wqGcrGWkrLa1wMSrZJyZnaWuqrPNZp%2BoqJWoerOx1aKtoqaXYsCpu9Zo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
