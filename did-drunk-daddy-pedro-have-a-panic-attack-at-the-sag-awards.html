That’s not to say he didn’t have a panic attack on stage; given how overwhelmed the actor was, no one could have blamed him for stepping outside for a moment if the occasion called for it. But, shortly after Pascal departed the stage, we all saw him backstage with one Tan France of Queer Eye fame, cracking jokes with nary a hint of the weight that seemed to be on his shoulders moments ago. There may have even been some flirting (*wink*).</p><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=false>In short, maybe Daddy Pedro did have a panic attack, maybe he didn’t, and he’s valid either way. The most important thing is that he was finally recognized for his work in The Last of Us, and we’re already eagerly anticipating his epic return as Joel in season 2. Until then, we will wait with bated breath to learn more about Pedro’s work in The Fantastic Four, which is already shaping up to be a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">much-needed Marvel comeback</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxqrCMnamupptisaKww7JkqZ2Up7xutMCvnGaZXaWur7XCZpitrJGYuG6t02aroZ1dqK6oecCwmKuco2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
