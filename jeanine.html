In the summer, I’m always hunting for different ways to use the herbs we grow on our back deck. When I’ve blended up a million batches of pesto and tossed together fifteen pasta salads, I start to wonder, “What next?” I thought to make these compound butter recipes when I was dreaming up ways to serve corn on the cob.

I love how many different varieties are available at this time of year – some are round and yellow, others are oblong and speckled with red. Still others are purple, orange, and green. When I see all these shapes and colors at the farmers market or grocery store, I can never resist bringing home some of each. They’re just so darn pretty (and delicious, too!). You can toss them into a salad, top…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Since it’s the season for all things Caprese (find my salad recipe here and my skewer recipe here!), I thought I’d go ahead and share a simple balsamic glaze recipe too. This punchy reduction couldn’t be easier to make, and its sweet and tangy flavor is the perfect accent for seasonal ingredients like basil and tomatoes. That being said, this balsamic glaze recipe can come in handy at other times of year, too. You can toss it with Brussels sprouts in the fall, drizzle it over roasted acorn squash in the winter, and serve it with ruby red strawberries in…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s peach season! For the next few weeks, I’ll come home with a bag of peaches after every trip to the farmers market or store. The season is just so short, so while it’s here, and fresh peaches are juicy, sweet, and abundant, I make it my goal to eat as many of them as I can. Some I devour plain, their sticky juice dripping down my chin. But I use even more in my favorite peach recipes. As you might expect, these peach recipes include desserts like crisps and cobblers. But they go way beyond that, too.

I should know, because I’ve just finished my [redacted] slice of the season, and I don’t see my healthy zucchini bread consumption slowing down anytime soon. 🙂 Like a traditional recipe, this healthy zucchini bread is moist, tender, and warmly spiced. It’s PACKED with zucchini, of course, but it also features a few other good-for-you ingredients that you wouldn’t find in a regular loaf. Almond flour adds protein and healthy fats, and it gives this loaf an especially moist texture. And instead of melted butter, olive oil brings richness.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Over the last few weeks, Jack and I have eaten more of these peanut butter no-bake cookies than we’d like to admit. They’re sweet and nutty, with an addictive chewy texture that comes from lots of peanut butter and whole rolled oats. We’ve pretty much had a constant supply of them on hand, because as soon as you finish one batch, it only takes a few minutes to whip up another and pop it in the fridge to chill. I recommend you enjoy these peanut butter no-bake cookies for dessert or an afternoon treat, but if I’m being totally honest,…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>If you’re looking for corn recipes to make this summer, you’re in the right place!
