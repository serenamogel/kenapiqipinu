The series pilot arrived on YouTube on Oct. 13, 2023, and within less than a month it was flirting with 100 million views. New fans are absolutely sprinting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to the zany animated offering</a>, and sharing their high hopes that it will earn a full season.</p><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>In the video’s caption over on YouTube, its creator, Gooseworx, and production company Glitch note that they’re aiming for a full season. Their website is linked to the video, along with their products page, which features a range of merchandise fans can buy up to rep their favorite characters — and, more importantly, to help secure the show enough funding to proceed. If enough merchandise sells, and enough people get on the Amazing Digital Circus train, a full season is all but fait accompli.</p><p data-characters=550 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=false>But, as for the actual question at hand — when do fresh episodes of The Amazing Digital Circus go up — we don’t really have an answer. If the show is successful in cinching the green light for its first full season, we may get more information about release schedules. For now, however, we have little more than a pilot and a dream to hang our hopes on. The show is absolutely popular enough to earn a full season, that much isn’t a question, but how fast that will happen, and when new episodes will arrive, are still up in the air.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSnZJ2nXam1pnnAppizoZ6ceqW1xqKrmqRdmLazr9SsZJ6omai8pbHSZqmepJWWwKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
