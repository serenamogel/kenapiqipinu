That is set to change in January 2023.</p><p data-injection=true>We can confirm that PGA Tour 2K23 will have crossplay functionality. This was confirmed via the Season 2 Clubhouse Report, released by the development team on January 11.</p><p>Crossplay <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will come to the game</a> on January 13 alongside ranked online play, the latter of which was a feature omitted from PGA Tour 2K23 at launch. Now, both will enter the course and give golf enthusiasts a new way to enjoy 2K23.</p><p data-injection=true>Per the development team, users will be able to match up with those from other platforms. The developers noted that room codes will be used in order to play with those through crossplay. Room codes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have been needed</a> for those who want to match up with friends in 2K23, so the devs are just expanding that feature.</p><p>PGA Tour 2K23 marks yet another sports game to feature crossplay. While some have opted not to add this feature, others like MLB The Show, NHL, and FIFA have in recent years. As more and more games move online, it’s great to see 2K keeping up with its contemporaries.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/472ba85d711be6fd6a8d8773e4f60c4a?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Chris Studley</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Chris is a staff writer for Gamepur who lives on the East Coast of the U.S. Chris has covered sports games, including the Madden, FIFA, NHL, NBA 2K, and MLB The Show franchises, for Gamepur since 2020.</p><h4><a href=#>More Stories by Chris Studley</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qK3Mnqeuql6YvK57xq6gnZ2jZLGwsdJmp6CZXam8tr6Ma6Jra12drrexjJypqKujpbmixYyapayvlaeypQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
