For two seasons, it dazzled a younger generation of True Believers, but I guess they’ll need to find their fix elsewhere as of now.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true>Considering how it’s been five months since the last episode aired and no word of a renewal came down, you might have seen this coming. It’s also worth mentioning how ratings dropped nearly 40% during the second season, so that had to factor into the execs’ decision to bring down the ax. And according to Deadline, options on the cast expired this week as well.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cloak-and-dagge-665x360.jpeg alt="cloak and dagger" width=640 height=346 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false>Here’s the statement Freeform provided to Deadline regarding the matter:</p><p>“We are so proud of&nbsp;Marvel’s Cloak & Dagger and the trailblazing stories this series told. We are also grateful to our incredible talent Oliva Holt and Aubrey Joseph for bringing these beloved characters to life, and showrunner Joe Pokaski for his vision. We’d like to thank our partners at Marvel Television for a wonderful two seasons and are we are hopeful that we can find another project together.”</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>Though I wouldn’t rule out a future Marvel show coming to Freeform somewhere down the line, it’s important to remind you of how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel TV is pretty much finished at this point</a> and that we exclusively reported last week that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Feige plans to reboot most of these characters in the MCU</a>, which this news seems to confirm. Like I said earlier, the focus has now been placed on the heroes over at Disney Plus, so that’s where we should turn our attention going forward.</p><p data-characters=149 data-current-count=149 data-injectable=false>Tell us, though, are you sad to see <strong>Cloak & Dagger</strong> go?
