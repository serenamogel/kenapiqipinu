Code also said that he respected Boruto because he worships Otsutsukis. But he also said that he was sorry that he had to feed Boruto to Ten-Tails so that the Sacred Tree could grow. Boruto fought against Code, who had the White Karma, even though Kawakaskedi&nbsp; him to leave.</p><p>As Boruto and Code fought, Code said that Boruto didn’t know how to use Karma right and that he only used it to get stronger and faster. He said that Otsutsuki’s battle experience is the true essence of Karma, which, if used correctly, can make anyone an expert warrior.</p><p>Code then tried to anger Boruto by stomping on him to show the true power of Momoshiki. But Boruto was able to avoid getting hit and use Momoshiki’s power because Code made him angry. As he used Momoshiki’s powers, he gave off a blue aura.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Add-a-heading-2023-03-15T231840.461.jpg decoding=async alt="Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292" width=640 height=360 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kawaki and Code thought that Momoshiki had taken over Boruto’s mind again, but to their surprise, Boruto was still in charge. Eida then told Code that it was possible that Amado’s medicine kept Boruto from letting Momoshiki take over his mind.</p><p>The Sensory Team and Naruto stopped looking for Kawaki and started looking for Boruto. Shikamaru told Naruto that they would go together since Code would be there as well. Naruto didn’t want Hinata to follow him because he was afraid that if they both died, Himawari would be left alone. Naruto also went into Sage Mode and followed the chakra of Boruto and Code.</p><p>Also Check Out:</p><p>Code, on the other hand, decided to leave and take Kawaki back to Eida. Kawaki fought him, though, and the fight started up again. In a different scene, Sai told Amado what was going on, which shocked Amado. He seemed to murmur that he hoped Kawaki wouldn’t mess things up for him and Amado.</p><p>Boruto couldn’t land a hit on the battlefield. He eventually passed out from being too tired and had a seizure. Code was about to attack Boruto at this point, but time seemed to stop. Then Momoshiki showed up and asked Boruto to switch places with him. As soon as Momoshiki took over Boruto’s mind, he attacked by making a huge Rasengan, which left Code speechless.</p><h2>Expectations From Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292</h2><p>Boruto episode 292 seems to pick up where episode 291 left off. In the preview for the episode, Kawaki cursed himself for getting himself into this situation and asked for more power.</p><p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theshahab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Add-a-heading-2023-03-15T231947.558.jpg decoding=async alt="Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292" width=640 height=360 data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>From what I can tell from the preview, Kawaki will probably think about what Amado said about Karma. Kawaki might be able to bring Karma’s power back to life and help settle things. The Momoshiki, on the other hand, took over Boruto’s body. So, Boruto and Kawaki might have to fight each other.</p><p>Also, Naruto and Shikamaru are likely to get there in episode 292 of Boruto. We don’t know how they will react yet, and they don’t have the power to fight Code, let alone Kawaki and Boruto after Otsutsuki fed them.</p><h2>Where To Watch Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292</h2><p>The second episode of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations will be on Crunchyroll and Funimation, just like the other episodes.</p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 292 will be the second-to-last episode of the first part of the series, ending on March 26, 2023. It will show how Boruto grows as a person and how evil threatens him and his loved ones and changes him.</p><p>Code tried to anger Boruto by stomping on him, but Boruto was able to avoid getting hit and use Momoshiki’s power, giving off a blue aura. Kawaki may be able to bring Karma’s power back to life and help settle things, while Boruto and Kawaki may have to fight each other.</p><p>The article is over now.
