The new season will bring more drama than ever and it’s set to debut on MTV on Tuesday, January 7, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>The original cast is returning but the group finds themselves divided after <a href=#><strong>Alex Kompothecras</strong> and <strong>Juliette Porter</strong>‘s split</a>. Meanwhile, new cast members join the group — including Robby, 30, bringing “conflict, heartbreak and deception to the mix.”</p><p>This season, Juliette graduates college and <a href=#>starts fresh with “new love” Robby</a>, who doesn’t get along with Alex. <strong>Chloe Trautman</strong> also doesn’t approve.</p><p>Us reported the <a href=#>news of Juliette and Robby’s relationship</a> in May. However, three months later they reportedly split. “I can’t give away too much storyline but things got hot and heavy,” Hayes teased to Us. “Things moved really quick. The <a href=#>show didn’t help that</a>. It expedited it quickly, and then you’ll have to wait and see.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Siesta-Key-Season-3-Robby-Hayes-and-Juliette-Porter-Heat-Up-02.jpg><p>Joining the show felt natural for the <a href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> alum, who grew up in Sarasota, Florida. “My agency, Rebella, had been working with a couple of the lead females [on Siesta Key] for modeling and personal branding and getting them deals,” he told Us. “And so this show, it kind of ties in nicely. I grew up in Sarasota. That whole friend group, the whole cast were my friends before they became the cast.”</p><p>Elsewhere in season 3, Alex is starting over with a new girlfriend but the same question from the past will arise: Can he stay faithful? <strong>Madisson Hausburg</strong> is pursuing acting in L.A. while dating a much older man. <strong>Brandon Gomes</strong> is still heartbroken over Madisson and pursues <strong>Amanda Marie Miller</strong>, something her ex <strong>JJ Mizell</strong> is not OK with.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For the first time in years, <strong>Kelsey Owens</strong> is single — until Robby’s BFF and business partner <strong>Jake Petersen</strong> catches her eye. However, <strong>Jared Kelderman</strong> still has feelings for her but when his ex-wife comes to town, things are shaken up. Meanwhile, <strong>Garrett Miller</strong> is still in a rocky relationship with <strong>Cara Geswelli</strong>.</p><p>The Siesta Key trailer will air during the premiere of Ex on the Beach: Peak of Love on MTV December 5, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmompKueqmt2J6qZqKfnru0edKinKyskWK4psWMrJyaq5%2BjenR5z6ucpqGVp7JusMCtnGaln6eybrXNn6Zo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
