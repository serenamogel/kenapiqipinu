Speaking of community, being part of the LGBTQIA+ community means different things to different people."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And much like Oreo preferences, people have Pride partying preferences. Because of this, I have compiled a list of what your choice in Oreo says about how you party during Pride Month.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vanilla-oreo-thins>Vanilla Oreo Thins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRIDE-OREOS-PARTYING-STYLE-JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_01.jpg><p>While you have pride, you are not celebrating Pride. Unless by “celebrating” you mean spending most of June in the Hamptons with your husband in a Vrbo-rented mini-mansion with another rich gay couple. Parades are your past. Pastry-laden brunches are your present. Your aesthetic is coastal grandmother and you will go to any lengths to achieve that, including trying to get an invite to an Ina Garten dinner party.&nbsp;<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-limited-edition-pride-oreos><strong>Limited Edition Pride Oreos</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRIDE-OREOS-PARTYING-STYLE-JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_02.jpg><p>This is your first year celebrating Pride and you will be doing so in a “QUEER AF” tank top from the Target Pride collection. You’re finally living as your authentic self and want literally everyone to know it. With your first-ever girlfriend by your side, you’re heading to the parade early so you don’t miss any of the action. Unfortunately, you will be blackout drunk before 2 p.m.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ultimate-chocolate-oreos><strong>Ultimate Chocolate Oreos</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRIDE-OREOS-PARTYING-STYLE-JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_03.jpg><p>You’re a big advocate for kink at Pride, and we thank you for your service.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chocolate-peanut-butter-pie-oreos><strong>Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie Oreos</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRIDE-OREOS-PARTYING-STYLE-JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_04.jpg><p>Pride is all about the daytime events for you because you are a parent now. You’re taking your toddler to a drag brunch and that baby will get more attention than any queen on the stage. Your whole family has coordinating rainbow outfits, including your pitbull mix. You’ll be celebrating all month long at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Angel City games</a> and kid-friendly breweries.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-classic-oreos><strong>Classic Oreos</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRIDE-OREOS-PARTYING-STYLE-JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_05.jpg><p>You are celebrating Pride at home in your safe space. You’re an introvert and all the festivities are simply too much for you. That being said, Pride is still important to you! While all the commotion is going on outside, you’ll be curled up on the couch with a copy of Fiona and Jane by Jean Chen Ho and a plate of the Trader Joe’s soup dumplings. Your cat is the only company you need.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-firework-oreos><strong>Firework Oreos</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRIDE-OREOS-PARTYING-STYLE-JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_06.jpg><p>If you reach for the Firework Oreos, you live to party and you’ll try anything at least once. You’re definitely the most fun person in your friend group. While, much like these Oreos, you and your partying style are an acquired taste, people can’t deny that you’re a good time. Your Pride weekend is jam-packed with events and you will absolutely be losing your phone.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-double-stuf><strong>Double Stuf</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRIDE-OREOS-PARTYING-STYLE-JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_07.jpg><p>You’re still partying for Pride, but way less than in years past because you are finally in a healthy relationship. The coordinating outfits you wear to the parade will let everyone know that. The effort you normally spend trying to find someone to hook up with will now be spent avoiding your partner’s ex. The goal and purpose of Pride weekend are to get that one perfect, very gay couple picture for Instagram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKiinrGmec6rnKhloKeyp7HRnqWcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
