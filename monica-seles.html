After moving to the United States to play tennis at age 13, Seles became the youngest player to take over the world's No. 1 ranking in 1991. She dominated the sport until 1993, when a fan of rival Steffi Graf stabbed her during a match in Germany. Following her official retirement in 2008, Seles became a successful author.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Monica Seles was born on December 2, 1973, in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, to Hungarian parents. Her father, Karolj Seles, taught her to play tennis in a parking lot when she was 5 years old, and as she grew up, she became intent on beating her brother Zoltan, who was eight years older and the No. 1-ranked junior tennis player in the country at the time. Her mother, Ester, and her grandmother thought that a girl shouldn't spend so much time playing tennis, but neither Seles nor her father heeded their advice.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tennis Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the age of 13, Seles was the No. 1 junior tennis player in the world. At 16, she beat Steffi Graf in the French Open, becoming the youngest person to win the tournament. The following year, the 17-year-old made history again as the youngest player to take over the world's No. 1 ranking.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the time, Seles was virtually unbeatable. From January 1991 through February 1993, she won 33 of the 34 tournaments she entered, including six Grand Slam singles titles.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Stabbing at the French Open</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At the age of 19, Seles was stabbed in the back by a crazed Steffi Graf fan during a tournament in Hamburg, Germany. She was treated for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the incident, and took a two-year hiatus before returning to the court in 1995. Although she won another Australian Open in 1996 and a bronze medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Seles never quite regained her competitive edge. She experienced a series of setbacks, including the death of her father in 1998, and a foot injury in 2003. She played her last match in 2003, and officially retired in 2008.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time she retired, Seles had claimed nine Grand Slam championships among her 53 career singles titles. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2009.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Other Endeavors</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Since retiring, Seles has spent time teaching at tennis clinics and speaking about the difficulties she faced with an eating disorder. She wrote a book in 2009, Getting a Grip: On My Body, My Mind, My Self. She soon launched herself into the world of young-adult fiction, penning the first two books of a series about a tennis boarding school entitled The Academy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2008, Seles competed on ABC's hit dance-competition show, Dancing with the Stars, but was eliminated in the first round. She had never danced before beginning rehearsals for the show.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Personal Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Seles became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of tennis, Seles works with animal charities. A resident of Sarasota, Florida, she began dating businessman and politician Tom Golisano—who is 30 years her senior—in 2009. They announced their engagement in June 2014.</p><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Monica Seles</li><li>Birth Year: 1973</li><li>Birth date: December 2, 1973</li><li>Birth City: Novi Sad</li><li>Birth Country: Serbia</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Monica Seles is a former No. 1-ranked women's tennis player with nine Grand Slam titles.
