With that being said, he certainly wasn’t afraid to give his thoughts on his appearance from The Rosie O’Donnell Show back in the day.</p><p>The following is a short statement from the attached tweet, as MJF continues to work the masses.</p><p class=p1>“When I said “that’s not me”, I am going to be honest. I lied, which as you all know is VERY unlike me. Matter of fact that was the first time I’ve ever lied. I’m very big on non-lying.</p><p class=p1>The child in the video was me. I’m not proud of it. My lack of pride in my national television appearance does not come from my excellent (duh) performance, but rather the treatment I received.</p><p class=p1>Rose O’Donnell is a hack. She is without doubt responsible for the surfacing of this clip. I think it’s pretty obvious that she’s attempting to attach herself to my constant rising star as her career continues to dwindle into obscurity. Not only was this video leaked without my consent, but my appearance on the show was traumatizing.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Thank you for your time and understanding. Not that you had anything better to do besides read this.</p><p>I’m not sorry. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/p05HXPwD0C</a></p><p>— Maxwell Jacob Friedman™️ (@The_MJF) <a href=#>April 2, 2019</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9wa29sZ2K6q7KMq5ylnZGosrR5wKasrKGenHq0wMCtnKadnql6sLqMq6asoZVivKW7zaecpaRdqLWww4yap6mdkaeur6%2FE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
