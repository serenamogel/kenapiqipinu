On one hand, you’re getting good deals for what you buy. On the other hand, you’re buying in bulk, so you better be hosting a crowd or you better be prepared to eat that very same Easter dinner repeatedly for the subsequent two weeks. But c’mon. Who doesn’t love a spiral cut ham and all the fixins (aka the default Easter meal)? If you’re dubious, grab a cart, a $1.50 hot dog combo, and let’s take a peek at some things you should be buying at Costco for an Easter dinner.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Kirkland Signature Spiral Sliced Ham</strong></a><p>Ham is to Easter as turkey is to Thanksgiving, and Costco is ready for the damn bunny to come hopping down the bunny trail, that’s for sure. This Kirkland spiral sliced ham is a real no-brainer if you’re looking for something traditional for your Easter dinner main dish. In true Costco fashion, this sucker is nine freaking pounds of meat, but if you don’t get through it in a few days, it should freeze just fine for snacking and sandwiches later on!</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Vicky’s Kitchen Organic Broccoli Cheddar Stuffed Chicken Breast</strong></a><p>Whether you don’t eat ham or you just like being a contrarian, I think it’s worth exploring an alternative main dish. We still need something that can hold its own at center stage, but it should be just as easy to cook as spiral ham (meaning it can be thrown in the oven and forgotten until the time goes off). This broccoli-stuffed chicken breast seems to tick both those boxes.</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Reser’s Main St Bistro Baked Scalloped Potatoes</strong></a><p>Now let’s get into the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-grocery-store-sides-for-easter/>Easter side dishes</a>! We need a potato, obviously, but let’s leave mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving. Scalloped potatoes, on the other hand, have major Easter energy to me, and Costco sells a three pound heat-and-heat tray of these puppies. Yes, you may have some leftovers, but, come on, three pounds of cheesy potatoes just sound like a damn good time.</p><strong><a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instacart.com/landing?product_id=2718196&retailer_id=5&region_id=91820199&utm_medium=sem_shopping&utm_source=instacart_google&utm_campaign=ad_demand_shopping_rp_costco_all-us_evergreen&utm_content=accountid-8145171519_campaignid-11614959806_adgroupid-121439801199_device-c&utm_term=targetid-pla-314343330631_locationid-9030930_adtype-pla_productchannel-online_merchantid-178347490_storecode-_productid-2718196&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwwMqvBhCtARIsAIXsZpYTRRQjQPDZ94-To9HUhHlw0RcioZ8dhiv66Vw1TrUnfqeayj9IKk4aAhyaEALw_wcB" rel=noopener>Del Monte Golden Sweet Whole Kernel Corn</a></strong><p>Corn on the cob won’t be in season for a few more months, so we recommend picking up a 12-pack of cans of Del Monte Sweet Whole Kernel Corn, which happens to be Sporked’s favorite <a href=#>canned corn</a>. Whether you’re making corn casserole, a corn salad, or succotash (honestly, we aren’t eating enough succotash as a society), this stuff is going to come in handy for Easter dinner. And then you’ll have 11 more cans to tide you over until summer.</p><p>Read our full ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-canned-corn/>best canned corn</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Chef Hak’s Roasted Brussels Sprouts with a Balsamic Glaze</strong></a><p>Here’s another no-prep Easter side I spotted at Costco. These balsamic vinegar-glazed Brussels sprouts just need to be heated in the air fryer for five minutes before they land on your Easter dinner table—they look so nice, no one will be the wiser. And hey, Chef Hak claims these are the “perfect side dish” right there on the box. Who am I to argue with Chef Hak?</p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>King’s Hawaiian Sweet Rolls 32 ct</strong></a><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t see the 40-count of <a href=# rel=noopener>Pillsbury Crescent Rolls</a> that I’ve seen at Costco on other trips (a real bummer), but this 32-pack of King’s Hawaiian rolls seems like a good substitute. Every Easter dinner needs a dinner roll for slathering with butter or for sopping up ham juice. Don’t be intimidated by the size of the package—we promise these squishy little suckers will disappear in no time.</p><p><strong>Read our ranking of the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-dinner-rolls/>best dinner rolls</a></strong></p><strong>Chicken Pot Pie with Rotisserie Chicken Breast</strong><p>This pot pie from Costco’s deli section is ideal for someone who wants to skip all of the above. Maybe you don’t want to do all that cooking, juggling of timers and oven space, and making sure everything is ready to plate at the same time so nothing gets cold. All valid reasons to just buy a massive chicken pot pie and call it a day. Or maybe you’re just someone who loves to shop at Costco but can’t get through a pallet full of food after all’s said and done. You just want to buy one item that feels Easter-y enough with a little bit of everything all in one—potatoes, corn, chicken, a bread of sorts. When it comes to the Easter dinner items you can buy at Costco, it doesn’t get easier than this.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="Aldi Fall Finds! | Sporked" title='Play video "Aldi Fall Finds! | Sporked"' rel=noopener>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3aegAv9xOg&list=PLHbjKrchTZztv-7UOi8GKRze15cUvRGmp</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mma6xXZu8s3nEmqqtnaJisaq6zZ6pZpmkYrCwv9Ocpmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
