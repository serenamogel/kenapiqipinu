There are thousands of problems that can cause a breakup, but in our case, <a href=#>it was not because of third parties</a> or infidelity.”</p><p class=p1>As Alejandro “assimilates” to his new normal post-split, he couldn’t keep quiet amid various reports that their romance had ended <a href=#>due to a cheating scandal</a>. “Out of respect for her, our families and everything we experienced, I could not remain silent and continue watching how they try to destroy the realest story of love that God has allowed me to live,” he noted. “Without further ado, I love my fans very much, thanks for being there.”</p><p class=p1>Alejandro and Rosalía, 30,<a href=#> first crossed paths at the 2019 Latin Grammy Awards</a>, nearly two years before confirming they were dating.</p><p class=p1>“I try to be with my girl. We fly a weekend off, if we can,” he told&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>&nbsp;</i>in January 2022 of their relationship. “There’s people that love drama, and we’re not like that. There’s a bunch of pop stars where it’s like the whole telenovela, and I hate that s—t. I really hate that s—t. We’re real stuff. We’ve been together for a while.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Rauw-Alejandro-Confirms-He-and-Rosalia-Split-inline.jpg><p class=p1>Alejandro went on to <a href=#>propose to the Spanish singer in March,</a> which was captured in their joint <a href=#>“Beso” music video</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We got engaged in the most beautiful way I could have ever imagined. That could ever exist,” Rosalía recalled of the proposal during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#><i>GQ</i></a>&nbsp;later that month, noting the special moment took place at his grandmother’s house in Puerto Rico. “I wasn’t expecting it, and you said, ‘Come, I want to show you a place.’ And I followed you, thinking nothing of it. I think you got down on one knee. I was nervous as well, so I don’t remember all the details.”</p><p class=p1>Rosalía has yet to address her breakup from Alejandro, however, <a href=#>eagle-eyed fans</a> noticed she seemingly held back tears while performing her “Hentai” ballad at <a href=#>Lollapalooza Paris</a> on Saturday, July 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmaWseqK4xKOYp5yipHqku82foKulo2K%2FsL%2FApaCaZaOluarAjJ2cp6GVqHqktMSaq6Kml2K%2FtrnOq6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
