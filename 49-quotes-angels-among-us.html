These quotes about angels among us remind us that amazing things can happen anywhere and anytime.</p><p></p><p>“Angels are not merely heaven’s window dressings.”</p><p>“Angels are winged with God’s power.”</p><p>“Angels can fly because they carry no burdens.”</p><p>“Angels may be very excellent sort of folk in their own way, but we, poor mortals in our present state, would probably find them precious slow company.”</p><p>“Angels never attack, as infernal spirits do. Angels only ward off and defend.”</p><p>“Angels worship God with purity and love; men, with fear and trembling.”</p><p>“Angels, living light most glorious! Beneath the Godhead in burning desire in the darkness and mystery of creation you look on the eye of your God never taking your fill: What glorious pleasures take shape within you!”</p><p>“Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?”</p><p>“Around our pillows golden ladders rise, and up and down the skies, with winged sandals shod, the angels come, and go, the Messengers of God.”</p><p>“Beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror which we are barely able to endure and are awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. Each single angel is terrifying.”</p><p>“Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.”</p><p>“Don’t be on the side of the angels, it’s too lowering.”</p><p>“Entertaining angels unawares: It is always we who are to entertain the angels, and never they us. I cannot, however, think that an angel would be a very entertaining person, either as guest or host.”</p><p>“Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.”</p><p>“For God will deign to visit oft the dwellings of just men — delighted, and with frequent intercourse — thither will send his winged messengers on errants of supernal grace.”</p><p>“Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!”</p><p>“How do the angels get to sleep when the devil leaves the porch light on?”</p><p>“How wonderful it must be to speak the language of the angels, with no words for hate and a million words for love.”</p><p>“I am a believer in angels, though not the picture-book kind with wings and harps. Such angelic accoutrements seem as nonsensical to me as devils sporting horns and carrying pitchforks. To me, angel wings are merely symbolic of their role as divine messengers.”</p><p>“I believe in angels, something good in everything I see.”</p><p>“I saw an angel close by me, on my left side, in bodily form. This I am not accustomed to see, unless very rarely.”</p><p>“I was walking among the fires of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments of Genius; which to Angels look like torment and insanity.”</p><p>“If angels rarely appear, it’s because we all too often mistake the medium for the Message.”</p><p>“If men were angels, no government would be necessary.”</p><p>“In Heaven an angel is nobody in particular.”</p><p>“It would be absurd if we did not understand both angels and devils, since we invented them.”</p><p>“It’s so dark right now, I can’t see any light around me.”</p><p>“It’s too cold outside for angels to fly.”</p><p>“Make friends with the angels, who though invisible are always with you…. Often invoke them, constantly praise them, and make good use of their help and assistance in all your temporal and spiritual affairs.”</p><p>“Man is a mixed being, made up of a spiritual soul and of a fleshly body; the angels are pure spirits, herein nearer to God, only that they are created and finite in all respects, free from decay, free from the power of death, whereas God is infinite and uncreated.”</p><p></p><p>“Man is his own star, and the soul that can render an honest and a perfect man commands all light, all influence, all fate. Nothing to him falls early, or too late. Our acts our angels are, or good or ill, our fatal shadows that walk by us still.”</p><p>“Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth — unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.”</p><p>“Nobody’s perfect. We’re all just one step up from the beasts and one step down from the angels.”</p><p>“One day you meet someone and for some inexplicable reason, you feel more connected to this stranger than anyone else–closer to them than your closest family.”</p><p>“Rejection is an opportunity for your selection.”</p><p>“Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.”</p><p>“She believed in angels, and, because she believed, they existed.”</p><p>“Sweet souls around us watch us still, press nearer to our side; into our thoughts, into our prayers, with gentle helpings glide.”</p><p>“That’s because the light is coming from you. You can’t see it but everyone else can.”</p><p>“The angels did not merely sin and lose heaven, but they passed beyond all other beings in sin and made themselves fit denizens for hell.”</p><p>“The death of God left the angels in a strange position. They were overtaken suddenly by a fundamental question. One can attempt to imagine the moment.”</p><p>“The very names assigned to angels by their Creator, convey to us ideas pre-eminently pleasing, fitted to captivate the heart, and exalt the imagination; ideas which dispel gloom, banish despondency, enliven hope, and awaken sincere and unmingled joy.”</p><p>“The world is like an enormous set of scales. When evil begins to outweigh good, angels cram themselves in on the lighter side. You can’t see them, but there they are, restoring the balance.”</p><p>“There is no reason why good cannot triumph as often as evil. The triumph of anything is a matter of organization. If there are such things as angels, I hope that they are organized along the lines of the Mafia.”</p><p>“They will come from the bright, sunny land, come on their pinions so fair; Jesus will send them its glory to tell, Angels will carry me there.”</p><p>“This is the state of all creatures, whether men or angels; as they make not themselves, so they enjoy nothing from themselves; if they are great, it must be only as great receivers of the gifts of God.”</p><p>“We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?”</p><p>“When angels visit us, we do not hear the rustle of wings, nor feel the feathery touch of the breast of a dove; but we know their presence by the love they create in our hearts.”</p><p>“When once we quit the basis of sensation, all is in the wind. To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings.”</p><p>There are many things that can set you apart from others and lead you to a path of greatness serving others in life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77ArZyyp5eWe7C%2BxmhrcmWhqry1sdJmmKeflaHAbq3MqKWgZaWofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
