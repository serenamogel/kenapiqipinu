He made it all the way to the semi-finals week of the program and won hearts by combining music and magic.</p><h2>Meet Mervant Vera, who will be appearing in AGT: All-Stars.</h2><p>Mervant Vera is a magician, mentalist, hip-hop musician, actor, writer, and content producer who previously performed on season 17 of America’s Got Talent in 2022. Mervant is from Philadelphia and has previously performed for celebrities, both virtually and physically, and had one of the largest virtual concerts during the epidemic. The multi-talented magician does more than simply perform illusions, and he does so while rapping along the way.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Mervant-Vera.jpg alt="Mervant Vera" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The future AGT: All-Stars contestant’s grandma, who he just lost, was the greatest fan of his magic. During his audition on AGT, he informed the judges that she was the one who convinced him not to stop magic. The mentalist went on to say that being on America’s Got Talent would be a stepping stone toward realizing his aspirations and, ideally, having his performance in Las Vegas one day.</p><p>He did a card trick while rhyming a tale for the crowd and the judges’ panel during his audition in 2022. His tale was about love, and he received a lot of it, earning three yeses and a vocal 4000 yeses from Simon Cowell, propelling him to the next round. Mervant avoided the Deliberations around and went to the semifinals.&nbsp;The AGT: All-Stars candidate started his semifinal performance by displaying his Rhyme book, which had all of the songs he’d composed so far, and asked Heidi to select a number between 1 and 50. She picked 49, which sent her to a website with the song Inspire.</p><p>The singer then requested that the presenter, Terry Crews, mix the flashcards with words printed on them, ensuring that the sequence was “as random as it could be.”</p><p>According to the AGT: All-Stars contestant:</p><p>“There are literally millions of potential ways to blend these phrases, but all we need is a rhythm.”</p><p>The magician then announced to the crowd that he would freestyle rap to the phrases that the presenter had previously jumbled up. Mervant informed Heidi Klum at the conclusion of his performance that he had a hunch she’d choose “Inspire” and had everyone look beneath their chairs. A sheet of paper with the phrase “Inspire” printed on it was placed on each seat.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Mervant-Vera-2.jpg alt="Mervant Vera" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Heidi praised the performance and dubbed the prospective AGT: All-Stars candidate a genius, adding that she enjoyed the “unique blend,” which they hadn’t had before. Simon went on to say that he could sense the anxiety in his voice, which made him like him even more. Watch what happens as the rapper and magician hit the stage again on Monday, January 2 at 8 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuucSrrZqmpGLDpr7AZp2rp51irqjAjJqjpWWjqa6zv4xrZ2trXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
