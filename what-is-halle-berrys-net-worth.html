While the number is high, we wonder how much it hurts a Hollywood celeb’s deep pockets. Hence, here is everything we found out about Halle Berry’s net worth.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-halle-berry-s-divorce-the-latest-one data-injectable=false>Halle Berry’s divorce (the latest one)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Halle_Berry.jpg><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>Halle Berry just legally ended her two-year-long marriage and eight-year-long divorce to fellow Hollywood hottie Olivier Martinez. Yes, you read that correctly. The two spent only two short years together and almost a decade in divorce! Yikes.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>The two got together on the film Dark Tide shortly after Berry’s split from model Gabriel Aubrey, with whom <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she shares a daughter</a>. She and Martinez came out as a couple in October 2010, but things weren’t exactly smooth sailing. There were reports of an all-out brawl between Aubrey and Martinez on Thanksgiving of that year, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aubrey was arrested</a>.</p><p data-characters=625 data-current-count=987 data-injectable=true>Shortly after that, Martinez and Berry revealed they were expecting a baby together and tied the knot in 2012. They had their son Maceo later that year. It was the third marriage for Berry, who was also married to baseball star David Justice and the musician Eric Benet. While she and Aubrey’s relationship was public and high profile, it was not a legal marriage. The divorce to Martinez was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently finalized,</a> revealing Berry would have to pay him $8000/month in child support, pay 4.3% of her income over $2 million, and pay for their now 9-year-old son’s schooling and tuition at his posh Los Angeles school.</p><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>While the split was initially reported to be “amicable,” it soon deteriorated into an eight-year-long divorce proceeding. The couple announced their split in 2015 to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, saying, “We move forward with love and respect for one another and the shared focus of what is best for our son. We wish each other nothing but happiness in life, and we hope you respect our and, most importantly, our children’s privacy as we go through this difficult period.”</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>You may recognize Berry’s third husband (yes, third) Martinez, from his starring role as the French heartthrob who won Diane Lane’s heart and broke up her marriage in the 2002 hit movie Unfaithful. He was also in 2013’s The Physician, 2004’s Taking Lives, and several others. Most recently, he appeared in several episodes of the 2002 show Loot. While he is known around Hollywood, he is nowhere near as famous as Halle Berry.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Halle Berry’s career</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=749 data-injectable=true>Berry has been in the spotlight practically her entire adult life. She started with a career in modeling and then transitioned to roles on the big screen. Her first big break was 1991’s Jungle Fever, and she has been on screen ever since. She played Storm in Brian Singer’s X-Men and has been in multiple hit movies such as Catwoman, Their Eyes Were Watching God, Gothika, Perfect Stranger, John Wick, Monsters Ball, and many, many more.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>She has been in the business for 30 years and counting and has won Academy Awards, Emmys, Golden Globes, Best Actress Awards, SAG awards, etc. Basically, if there’s an award for it, she’s probably won it or at least been nominated for it. So with all that clout, what does that translate to in terms of her financial standing?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How much is Halle Berry worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Halle Berry (@halleberry)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=684 data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true>Halle Berry has a net worth of $90 million. She averages anywhere from $10-12 million per movie! She initially was ordered to pay her ex Aubrey $16,000/month in child support for her now 15-year-old daughter Nahla but was able to have that lowered to $8,000/month with a $110,000 annual cap. She will pay Martinez $8,000/month for child support for their son Maceo. So in total, she will now be paying roughly $206,000/year in child support. Yet out of her $90 million net worth, that’s a drop in the bucket. Basically, if all Berry did was do one movie in a year, she could pay off all her child support and still have money left over for a mansion in Malibu. Or two. Amazing.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>Although it may be a small sum in cash, in principle, Berry feels it is a lot. Her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 Instagram post</a> made no bones about how she feels about these payouts, basically saying women do not owe men and that this type of payout is extortion. Tell us how you really feel, Halle.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=false>So, long story short, Halle Berry is worth $90 million and counting, minus about $200,000/year in child support payouts. Oh, and 4.3% of anything over $2 million she makes. Regardless, we doubt this Hollywood queen will be hurting for money anytime soon. Although with three divorces and counting, love might be a different story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZiWua2xjJucq6qpqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
