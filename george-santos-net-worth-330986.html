In January of 2023, he fell under scrutiny when elements of his resume and statements about his past came to light as untrue. Among the discrepancies were that he did not graduate from the college he claimed to, he did not work for the firms he said he did, he is not Jewish and he never actually formed the animal rescue charity he said he had. Beyond that, it was revealed he was charged with check fraud in Brazil.</p><p>After accusations were made, Santos admitted he had never graduated from college. He worked temporarily as a Portuguese-language customer service agent for the DISH network. He was elected in November of 2022 to an open congressional seat in New York, defeating democratic candidate Robert Zimmerman.</p><p>Despite admitting what he calls his "embellishments", he has made no move to step down from his appointed office. His santos4_congress Instagram has 120,000 followers. He posts relevant tweets, pictures with other political figures, and promotional advertisements to vote for him.</p><p>He is the openly gay son of Brazilian immigrants. He lives with his sister in Long Island. His mother died in 2016, though previously he alleged that she died in the World Trade Center attack in 2011.</p><p>In December 2022, he posted a tweet that publicly called Kanye West a clown and a fool.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeXmryzs8RmqpqmpKTAbrrErWSwp6KptW5%2FkmlwcW4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
