Fortunately, there are a number of different ways you can do this with greater accuracy. Solutions run the gamut from easy to more difficult and include both software and hardware options.</p><p>Here's how to quickly and easily measure your computer's power consumption in a few steps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><h2>Use an online calculator</h2><p>If you want to just get a rough idea of how much power your system uses, then a quick calculator can save you a lot of hassle with taking measurements.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to the OuterVision website and open its <a href=#>Power Supply Calculator page</a>.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the Expert or Basic tab depending on your level of expertise and how much you know about your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Input as much information as you can, including components, coolers, whether you've overclocked your system, and any other relevant information you can think of.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When you're ready, hit Calculate to get a rough idea of how much power your PC uses on a daily basis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2>Add it up with HWInfo</h2><p>HWInfo is an excellent tool for tracking all sorts of aspects of your PC, including its power usage. But you'll have to do a little math.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Head to the <a href=#>HWInfo official site</a> and download the app. Install it like you would any other, following the on-screen instructions.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Run the app, and when prompted, select Sensors only >OK.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> HWInfo has a lot of detail, so it can be a bit overwhelming to start with. The information you need is here -- you just have to find it.</p><p>Scroll down until you find the CPU section, then look for CPU Package Power. That's the total power your CPU is pulling at that time. Next, look for your <a href=# data-injected=1>graphics card</a>, and find either Total Graphics Power, or Total Board Power.</p><p>Add these figures together to get a good idea of how much power your system uses. If your motherboard and memory support it, you may have power sensors for those too. Add that together for greater accuracy.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Also consider putting your PC in a load state and then retaking the readings so you know how much power you use while gaming or other tasks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2>Measure power consumption with hardware</h2><p>If you want to get the best readings for the overall power usage of your computer, you will need to measure the connection from a wall outlet with an external power meter, such as a <a href=#>P3 Kill A Watt Electricity Monitor</a>. This power meter will let you take an accurate measurement of your PC’s power consumption, and is available from Amazon, Home Depot, hardware stores, and other retailers for around $20 to $40.</p><p>Simply plug it in, plug your PC's power cable into it, then turn your PC on. The power use will be displayed on the Kill A Watt meter.</p><p>Now that you know how to check your system's power usage, you might want to think carefully about future upgrades. The <a href=#>best graphics cards</a> might make your games pretty, but they do use a lot of power.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfmLyuvNStoKefX528uHnTqGSmnZGowrOxjKmaZqifrLKzedSsnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
