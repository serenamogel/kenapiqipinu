Her heaviest weight, 717lb, aired on 1000-lb Sisters season 4 before she burst into tears at the scale numbers.</p><p>Since then, Tammy appears to have lost a considerable amount of weight. Her progress hasn’t gone unnoticed by fans, who are now flooding her social media comments with tons of praise as 2023 gets underway.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tammy-slaton-s-weight-loss>Tammy Slaton’s weight loss</h2><p>When <a href=#>1000-lb Sisters</a> first hit TLC in 2020, Tammy weighed 714lb. She lost weight, then put it back on, and along the way, faced serious health issues as a result of her weight. When season 4 was filmed, Tammy had gone up to 715lb.</p><p>However, things got better. Tammy got weight loss surgery in August 2022,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The US Sun</a>&nbsp;reports. The gastric bypass procedure took place in Lexington, Kentucky, after she lost enough weight to be approved.</p><p>The surgery took place before her wedding day. Tammy is now reportedly standing and walking. After the two-week recovery process ended, Tammy chose to remain in rehab where nurses monitor her trach.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-recent-pictures-of-1000-lb-sisters-star>Recent pictures of 1000-lb Sisters star</h2><p>Tammy has been sharing a few updates which hint at her extreme weight loss. She shared a video working out in rehab, as well as a video with her husband Caleb Willingham, where she appeared to look a lot slimmer.</p><p>She told fans she “wish I could talk about all the stuff that’s going on with my weight and my hair and my clothes,” but added that she can’t reveal any updates due to not wanting to give TLC fear of missing out.</p><p>It is expected that Tammy’s weight loss will air on 1000-lb Sisters season 5. Her TikTok account is her most active form of social media, with her last post on January 14. She usually shares videos rather than pictures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@tammyslaton2020 href=#>@tammyslaton2020</a><p>Replying to @blondi19570</p><a title="♬ original sound - Tammy willingham" href=#>♬ original sound – Tammy willingham</a></figure>View TikTok<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tammy-in-2023-fans-see-a-difference>Tammy in 2023: Fans ‘see a difference’</h2><p><a href=#>Tammy</a> has strayed from posting too many pictures in 2023, as she explained she is on contract with TLC and therefore can’t update fans on her weight loss progress.
