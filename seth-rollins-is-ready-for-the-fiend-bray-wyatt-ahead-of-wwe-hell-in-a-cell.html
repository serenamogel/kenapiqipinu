The build-up has been interesting to say the least, with Seth quite clearly being afraid of The Fiend and everything that comes alongside his appearances. Now, though, he needs to step up – because otherwise, Wyatt will walk all over him.
Despite the seemingly impossible odds that face him, both with the bookmakers and with the fans, Seth is more than ready to face whatever comes his way."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unfortunately, despite how much hype there was for his Universal Championship reign when he first won it, nobody seems to be interested in the idea of his time as champion continuing.</p><p>That’s probably because The Fiend has taken off in a way that few could’ve imagined. He could quite easily hold the belt all the way through until WrestleMania if he does wind up winning it, and that’s what we’d put our money on.</p><p>There are so many great challengers for Bray if he does become champion but before all of that, we need to remember some of the best moments from Rollins’ reign – because it may be a while before he gets it back.</p><p>Either way, there is a great deal of potential in the actual match itself on Sunday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e5BpZmlqX6iytbSMq6alpJmjwG610mapnpmUrnqnu9Fmq6GdXZu2prrDZpmrmalixLqt061kmqCVlrFuu8VmrrCdXZ2yrbiMoqVmmV2Ysq24jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
