Anastasia said her husband was courageous and had asked his close friends to refrain from texting and to contact him while receiving hospice care. She went on, saying:</p><p>“I don’t believe we expected this day to arrive since he is so strong and has overcome it so many times.” Thank you for your kind words, but as the news spreads, it’s becoming too much for me, and I’m going to have to take a step back. I adore you and appreciate your help.”</p><h2>Everything there is to know about The Amazing Johnathan</h2><p>Born on September 9, 1958, The Amazing Johnathan’s comedy and magic show comprised mainly of antics, audience interactions, and a few legitimate magic skills.
