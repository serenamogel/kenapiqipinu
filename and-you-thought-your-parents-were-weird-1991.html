The talking computer is from “2001” by way of “Look Who’s Talking.” The bright kids are from “Real Genius” by way of “<a href=#>Weird Science</a>.” The clever, precocious robot is from “<a href=#>Short Circuit</a>.” The high school rivalry is from every other high school movie ever made, and when the boys’ mom has to choose between her boyfriend and the ghost of her dead husband, it’s hard not to think about “<a href=#>Chances Are</a>.” Is the movie worth seeing on its own? Only marginally; it’s the kind of entertainment that seems like more fun on Nickelodeon than when you paid for your ticket. Joshua Miller is an interesting hero - intense, earnest and thoroughly adolescent - and A.J. Langer brings a certain bounce to his tomboy girlfriend. But the plot is needlessly labyrinthine - there’s a limit to how many schemes we can keep straight at a time. And the physical stunts seem forced and unlikely. The strangest thing about it is that the parents in the movie are less weird than just about everybody else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46apZ1lqaTCbsDHqKygoKRixrDB0WanmqqVo8G0edaeqZ5lp5q2s7CManByaQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
