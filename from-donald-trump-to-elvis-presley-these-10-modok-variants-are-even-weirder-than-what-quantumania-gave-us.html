The whole point of the character — whose acronym generally stands for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing, although sometimes Mechanized is replaced with Mental — is that he’s often used as an outlet by Marvel creators to poke fun at their own universe. Something that’s made abundantly clear by M.O.D.O.K.’s many hilarious and off-beat variants in the comics. Don’t believe us? Take a look at these eggheads…</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-zombie-m-o-d-o-k data-injectable=false>Zombie M.O.D.O.K.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/what-if-zombies-e1677084811923.jpg><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>Thanks to the existence of the Marvel Zombies universe — commonly known as Earth-Z — we have dystopian variants of many a familiar character. Surprisingly, though, despite his big brain, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Earth-Z’s M.O.D.O.K.</a> didn’t survive for long as Evil Dead crossover comic Marvel Zombies/Army of Darkness #3 featured a shot of Tarleton’s skeletal corpse being picked clean by Zombie Hawkeye and Zombie She-Hulk. Bleurgh.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aldrich-killian-m-o-d-o-k data-injectable=false>Aldrich Killian M.O.D.O.K.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/aldrich-killian-iron-man-3.jpg><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>The MCU’s M.O.D.O.K. turning out to be a mutated Darren Cross was a wild take on the character, but surprisingly it’s not the first time the franchise has played with the idea of turning a prior villain into the big-headed bad guy. The non-canon Iron Man 3: The Official Game previously imagined that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aldrich Killian’s consciousness</a> was downloaded by A.I.M. into a deformed clone body just before his death. Yes, basically he was Palpatine-d.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-d-e-a-d-p-o-o-l data-injectable=false>D.E.A.D.P.O.O.L.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/9EAF4325-1BAA-4DF8-891A-EB9E7789526F.jpeg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Deadpool variants don’t tend to get along, as is the case with Dreadpool and his army of evil Deadpools who invaded Earth-616 in an attempt to kill the prime Wade Wilson. Among his troops was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">D.E.A.D.P.O.O.L.</a>, a M.O.D.O.K. mash-up. He probably wasn’t one of the smartest variants of either character, though, as he was quickly dispatched by Wade’s ally, Pandapool.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mo-skull data-injectable=false>Mo-Skull</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/mo-skull.jpg><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>Sometimes you don’t need another universe to be introduced to get a weird variant, sometimes they can just be dreamed up by some random character in a bizarre fantasy sequence. Such is the case with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mo-Skull</a>, who — as you can probably guess — is a blend of M.O.D.O.K. and Red Skull. When civilian Bernie Rosenthal had a vision of herself as Bernie America, she imagined stopping Mo-Skull from conquering the galaxy to… start his own chain of Pizza Huts? OK, you do you, Mo-Skull.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-m-o-o-d-o-k data-injectable=false>M.O.O.D.O.K.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/MOODOK-Marvel.jpg><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Spider-Ham’s Earth is home to the greatest puns in the entire Marvel multiverse, with Peter Porker’s allies and enemies all being hilarious animalistic twists on familiar characters. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">There’s Kangaroo the Conqueror</a>, Ducktor Doom and The Bee-Yonder, but right now we’re going to shine a light on the simple brilliance of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">M.O.O.D.O.K.</a>, who is indeed a variant of M.O.D.O.K. who just happens to be a cow.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-b-r-o-d-o-k data-injectable=false>B.R.O.D.O.K.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/brodok-west-coast-avengers-1.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>This one isn’t actually a variant from a different universe but another form taken by 616’s M.O.D.O.K. himself. During a short-lived attempt at redemption, George Tarleton built himself a new, much hotter, body, and dedicated his life to finding romance, rebranding himself as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">B.R.O.D.O.K.</a> (Bio-Robotic Organism Designed Overwhelmingly for Kissing). Unfortunately, no woman wanted him and he swiftly returned to his supervillain ways.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-m-o-d-o-r-d data-injectable=false>M.O.D.O.R.D.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/modord-marvel-1.png><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>As evidenced in the above entry, many of the multiverse’s M.O.D.O.K.s are designed for other things apart from killing, some of which are strangely specific. That’s the case with M.O.D.O.R.D., aka Mental Organism Designed Only for Roller Derby. It’s unclear exactly what his purpose was originally, but he came in handy for the Grandmaster when he challenged the X-Men member Dazzler to a roller derby championship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-m-o-d-o-k-but-the-k-stands-for-knitting data-injectable=false>M.O.D.O.K.

When the LEGO Avengers infiltrated A.I.M., they discovered the existence of one of the original M.O.D.O.K.’s experimental siblings. Although they sport the same acronym, this M.O.D.O.K. is actually a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mental Organism Designed Only for Knitting</a>. Because sometimes even supervillains need some nice warm woolen wear.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-elvis-presley-m-o-d-o-k-s data-injectable=false>Elvis Presley M.O.D.O.K.s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/elvis-modok.jpg><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>No, this isn’t an Elvis Presley variant who became a M.O.D.O.K. (at least, we don’t think), it’s much stranger than that. When anti-terrorist superhero team Nextwave — which includes the likes of Elsa Bloodstone and Monica Rambeau — infiltrated the Beyond Corporation’s State 51 facility, they were faced with a trio of M.O.D.O.K. clones who for some reason looked like The King. Could this be the perfect role for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Austin Butler in the MCU</a>?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>M.O.D.A.A.K</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Donald-Trump-MODAAK.jpg><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=false>The Elvis M.O.D.O.K.s come close, but the weirdest M.O.D.O.K. variant bar none has to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">M.O.D.A.A.K.</a> aka Mental Organism Designed As America’s King. Hailing from Spider-Gwen’s reality, M.O.D.A.A.K. is an extremely thinly veiled parody of Donald Trump, who was running for office of the comic’s publication. While it’s not pleasant to think about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump existing throughout the multiverse</a>, at least we know that in every universe he has tiny hands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX5u%2FsLmMnaanmZyZerW%2B1KanZqyfYrKtwsisZKmqlai5psWMrZ%2Beq5VifnF5zKibqKNdq66ztcCnq6xlkaeybrHVnqVmr5Wev6Wx0WaroZmeYsSprdNmqK6ZnqnCrq3Nophmn5Grsm7B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
