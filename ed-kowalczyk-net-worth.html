Ed’s career started in 1984.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Ed Kowalczyk is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Kowalczyk’s net worth is as high as $8 million, earned through his successful career in the music industry.</p><h3>Ed Kowalczyk Net Worth $8 Million</h3><p>Ed is of Polish ancestry and has a younger brother, Adam, who is also a musician and would often perform as an opening act for Ed and Live, with his own band Portion. Ed went to William Penn Senior High School, where he had met his future bandmates, Chad Taylor, Patrick Dahlheimer and Chad Gracey, who already played as a trio under the name Action Front. They then went through several name changes, and settled for Public Affection, and under that name recorded a demo tape entitled “The Death of a Dictionary”. Soon they recorded the EP “Divided Mind, Divided Planet” (1990), produced by Jay Healy. Little by little their name became known, and the group started performing regularly at CBGB in New York City, and in no time signed a recording contract with the Radioactive Records.</p><p>Their first album for Radioactive Records came out in 1991, entitled “Mental Jewelry”, which achieved platinum status in the USA, increasing Ed’s net worth and encouraging him and the rest of the members to continue to produce music.</p><p>Just three years later they released “Throwing Copper”, which became their best album, since it topped the charts in several countries, including the US and Australia, while it also achieved eight times platinum status in USA, Australia and seven times platinum in Canada. They continued in the same rhythm, releasing albums “Secret Samadhi” (1997), which also topped the US Billboard 200 chart, and “The Distance to Here” (1999), which was also platinum certified, increasing Ed’s net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Before Ed’s departure, they released three more albums, but their popularity began to decline, however “Birds of Pray” (2003) still achieved platinum status, and “Songs from Black Mountain”, reached gold certification.</p><p>Ed then left to launch a solo career, and released two studio albums – “Alive” (2010), “The Flood and The Mercy” (2012), and also an EP “The Garden” in 2012, which also improved his wealth.<br>Most recently, Ed returned to Live in late 2016, and the group is currently on tour.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Ed has been married to Erin Broderick since 1997; the couple has four children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Bald head</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Former lead singer for the band Live.
