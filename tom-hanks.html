He starred in the television sitcom Bosom Buddies, but became far more known when he starred in the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/ron-howard data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ron Howard" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ron Howard</a> film Splash. He went on to headline many more popular and acclaimed movies, including Big, Forrest Gump and Cast Away, en route to becoming one of the most powerful and well-respected actors in Hollywood.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hanks was born on July 9, 1956, in Concord, California. Hanks' parents divorced when he was 5 years old, and he was raised, along with his older brother and sister, by his father, a chef named Amos. The family moved frequently, finally settling in Oakland, California, where Hanks attended high school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating in 1974, Hanks attended junior college in Hayward, California. He decided to pursue acting after reading and watching a performance of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/eugene-oneill data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eugene O'Neill" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Eugene O'Neill</a>'s The Iceman Cometh (1946), and transferred into the theater program at California State University in Sacramento.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1977, Hanks was recruited to take part in the summer session of the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Lakewood Ohio. Over the next three years, Hanks spent his summers acting in various productions of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/william-shakespeare data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Shakespeare class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Shakespeare</a>'s plays and his winters working backstage at a community theater company in Sacramento. He won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor in 1978, for his portrayal of Proteus in The Two Gentlemen of Verona.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Movies and Career</h2><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Big Break With 'Splash'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By 1980, Hanks had dropped out of college, and after his third season with the Great Lakes festival, he moved to New York City. Many rounds of auditions later, he landed a small part in the 1980 slasher film He Knows You're Alone. That same year he was spotted by a talent scout for ABC and was cast in the television sitcom Bosom Buddies, playing one of two advertising executives who dress in drag in order to rent an apartment in an all-female building.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The show was cancelled after two seasons, but it gave Hanks some exposure and led to his casting in guest roles on various episodes of popular shows like Happy Days (1974-84), Taxi (1978-83), The Love Boat (1977-87) and Family Ties (1982-89). In 1982, Ron Howard, co-star of Happy Days and now working as a director, remembered Hanks and had him read for a supporting part in a movie. That supporting role eventually went to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/john-candy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Candy" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">John Candy</a>, and Hanks instead landed the lead role in Howard's Splash (1984) as a man who falls in love with a mermaid, played by Daryl Hannah. The movie became a surprise hit, and Hanks was suddenly a recognizable face.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A string of panned films followed, most notably Bachelor Party (1984), The Man With One Red Shoe (1985), Volunteers (1985), The Money Pit (1986) and Dragnet (1987). Hanks managed to emerge relatively unscathed from these critical failures, as reviewers often pointed to his performance as the best thing about each movie.</p><img alt="Penny Marshall directing Tom Hanks in Big" title="Penny Marshall directing Tom Hanks in Big" width=2017 height=2001 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/penny-marshall-director-tom-hanks-1988-on-set-tm-and-copyright-c-20th-century-fox-film-corp-all-rights-reserved-courtesy-everett-collection.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Courtesy of Everett Collection</span><p>Penny Marshall directing Tom Hanks in ’Big.’</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Major Hit: 'Big'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1988, Hanks was finally cast in a star-making role in director <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/penny-marshall data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Penny Marshall" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Penny Marshall</a>'s Big, playing a 13-year-old boy transplanted overnight into the body of a 35-year-old man. His performance charmed both critics and audiences, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for best actor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With Big, Hanks established that he could be a box-office draw as well as a talented actor. Over the next few years, his projects failed to match the critical or commercial success of that film, although they did display Hanks' wide range, from lighthearted comedies (1989's Turner and Hooch, 1990's Joe Versus the Volcano) to more dramatic fare (1988's Punchline, 1990's Bonfire of the Vanities).</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Oscar Wins for 'Philadelphia' and 'Forrest Gump'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following a memorable performance as the manager of an all-women's baseball team in A League of Their Own (1992), Hanks enjoyed two huge hits in 1993: Sleepless in Seattle, a romantic comedy written by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/nora-ephron data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nora Ephron" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nora Ephron</a> that rematched him with his Joe Versus the Volcano co-star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/meg-ryan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meg Ryan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meg Ryan</a>; and Philadelphia, co-starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/denzel-washington data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Denzel Washington" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Denzel Washington</a>. In the latter film, Hanks played a lawyer fired from his high-paying firm because he has AIDS, delivering a courageous performance that earned him an Academy Award for best actor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He followed up on that tremendous year with the release of Forrest Gump (1994), the sprawling story of an unlikely hero's path through 20th-century American history, directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film was a phenomenal box office success, winning Oscars for best picture and director. For his part, Hanks brought home his second straight lead actor Oscar, becoming the first person in 50 years to accomplish that feat.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Blockbusters: 'Apollo 13,' 'Toy Story,' 'Saving Private Ryan'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1995, Hanks starred in another blockbuster, Apollo 13, a Howard film based on the abortive lunar landing mission of the Apollo 13 spacecraft in 1970. The film was released in the IMAX format in 2002. Like Forrest Gump, the film made more than $500 million at the box office. Also in 1995, he headlined the voice cast of Toy Story, the first major film of the Disney/Pixar partnership.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following year, Hanks made his directorial and screenwriting debut with That Thing You Do!, which enjoyed moderate success. He continued his behind-the-camera duties in the Emmy-winning HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon, which he produced, directed, wrote and acted in for various episodes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1998, he starred in another groundbreaking blockbuster, Saving Private Ryan, a World War II drama directed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/steven-spielberg data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Steven Spielberg" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Steven Spielberg</a> and filmed with gruesome accuracy. While the film was nominated for director and actor Academy Awards and was a favorite for best picture, only Spielberg took home the Oscar. Also that year, Hanks teamed once more with Ryan and Ephron in the hit romantic comedy You've Got Mail.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Toy Story 2,' 'The Green Mile,' 'Cast Away'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hanks soared to the top of the holiday box office in late 1999 as he reprised his role as the voice of Woody, the cowboy at the center of 1995's animated film Toy Story. Toy Story 2, also featuring the voice of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.biography.com/people/tim-allen-9542074 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tim Allen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tim Allen</a>, surpassed all expectations at the box office, grossing a record-breaking $80.8 million when it opened over Thanksgiving weekend. He also starred in The Green Mile during this time, which shot to No. 2 at the box office, behind Toy Story 2, in its opening weekend. The film was set in a Depression-era prison and adapted from a story by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/stephen-king data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen King" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stephen King</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hanks underwent a striking physical transformation to play a man stranded on a desert island in his next film, the long-awaited Cast Away (2000), directed by Zemeckis and co-starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/helen-hunt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Helen Hunt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Helen Hunt</a>. His performance propelled the film to the top of the holiday box office, earning Hanks critical raves and yet another well-deserved Oscar nomination for best actor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having already notched an imposing record of box office hits, his accessible good looks and regular-guy charisma earning him comparisons with screen legends of the past like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jimmy-stewart data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jimmy Stewart" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jimmy Stewart</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/cary-grant data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cary Grant" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cary Grant</a>, Henry Fonda and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/gary-cooper data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gary Cooper" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Gary Cooper</a>, Hanks in 2002 was honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, making him the youngest actor ever to receive that honor.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'The Da Vinci Code,' 'Charlie Wilson's War' and Broadway</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2002, Hanks produced the surprise hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding, starring Nia Vardalos. He was back on the big screen in 2004 with Joel and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/ethan-coen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ethan Coen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ethan Coen</a>'s remake of the classic 1955 comedy The Ladykillers, Spielberg's comedy-drama The Terminal and the family film The Polar Express.

The film grossed more than $750 million worldwide. During the 2007 Christmas season, Hanks appeared as the lead in Charlie Wilson's War, a drama based on a Texas congressman's efforts to assist Afghan rebels in their war with the Soviets. The performance earned Hanks a Golden Globe nomination.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2009, Hanks starred in Angels and Demons, the sequel to Da Vinci. He went on to perform voiceover work for the acclaimed TV miniseries The Pacific (2010) and Toy Story 3 (2010), before starring in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011) and Cloud Atlas (2012).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a monumental screen career, Hanks made his Broadway debut in the 2013 production of Lucky Guy. He impressed enough to garner a Tony Award nomination for best performance by a lead actor, but lost out to Tracy Letts of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Saving Mr. Banks,' 'Bridge of Spies,' 'The Post'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Also in 2013, Hanks played the title character of the nautical thriller Captain Phillips and portrayed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/walt-disney data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walt Disney" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Walt Disney</a> in Saving Mr. Banks, which focuses on how the studio head convinced <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/pl-travers data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="P.L.

The autumn 2015 outing saw the actor reunited with director Spielberg. In November 2016, Hanks received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/barack-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barack Obama" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barack Obama</a> for his contribution to the arts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2017, Hanks teamed up with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/meryl-streep data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Meryl Streep" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Meryl Streep</a> for Spielberg's The Post, about the drama surrounding the Washington Post's publication of the Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War.
