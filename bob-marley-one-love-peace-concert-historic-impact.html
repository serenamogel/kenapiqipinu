But while the “Third World Woodstock” offered a brief moment of hope and marked a personal triumph for Marley, the peace he envisioned for Jamaica was still far away.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Jamaica was rife with political violence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the mid-1970s, Jamaica was gripped with gang activity and street violence due to the divisions between the PNP and JLP.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Michael Manley, the figurehead of the PNP, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://jacobin.com/2021/06/bob-marley-jamaica-peace-concert-photo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="was elected prime minister" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">was elected prime minister</a> in 1972. He had gained popularity following the “Rodney Riots” four years earlier, in which Kingstonians acted out after the JLP-led government banned Walter Rodney, a popular Guyanese lecturer and socialist figure, from returning to the country. The Black Power and Rastafarian movements had also begun to take hold during the late ’60s, and Manley won the support of many youthful Jamaicans disillusioned by joblessness and poverty as he promised to “make better come” to the country.</p><img alt="michael manley, stands above and reaches out to a crowd, he smiles and shakes peoples hands, he wears a suit" title="Michael Manley, circa 1976" width=1024 height=701 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/michael-manley-news-photo-1707943940.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Michael Manley</p><img alt="edward seaga speaking into a microphone and holding his hands in front of him, he wears a suit jacket, tie, and collared shirt" title="Edward Seaga, circa 1981" width=825 height=1040 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/edward-seaga-news-photo-1707944152-web-65cd2a2825fdf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Edward Seaga</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But around the time Manley’s government fully committed itself to democratic socialism in 1974, Edward Seaga, who helped redevelop the Tivoli Gardens area of Kingston into a thriving community, had emerged as a rival representing the more conservative, free market–oriented JLP. Divisions between the parties fermented, and street gangs in support of both sides began committing acts of violence in the poorer communities of Kingston and other cities. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://jacobin.com/2021/06/bob-marley-jamaica-peace-concert-photo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to scholar Brian Meeks" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to scholar Brian Meeks</a>, indiscriminate shootings and the burning of whole city blocks were among the worst atrocities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By the time of the country’s December 1976 elections, more than 160 serious crimes were being committed per week. As a result, Manley declared a state of emergency, stoking even more anger within the JLP who felt it was done for political reasons, not public safety. The government tried to bring the two sides together just before the election but unknowingly put the country’s biggest celebrity at risk.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marley was nearly assassinated in 1976</h2><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Bob Marley - Mini Biography" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/78330e4f-d26e-4105-9d2c-1fb747effe5b/78330e4f-d26e-4105-9d2c-1fb747effe5b_image.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Bob Marley and his band, the Wailers, were globally known by this time, having toured Britain and the United States and even performing as an opening act for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bruce-springsteen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bruce Springsteen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bruce Springsteen</a>. This was largely thanks to Chris Blackwell (portrayed in the movie by James Norton), who founded the Island Records label and helped Marley and other reggae artists achieve mainstream popularity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With his influence within Jamaica well-established, Marley became the target of what appeared to be a politically-motivated attempt on his life in 1976. The singer and his band were preparing for a performance at Smile Jamaica, a free concert organized by the PNP-led government in an effort to diffuse tensions. On December 3, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/bob-marley data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gunmen attacked Bob, wife Rita, and the band" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">gunmen attacked Bob, wife Rita, and the band</a> at the singer’s home.
