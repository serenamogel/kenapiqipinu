He murders people he loves, while loving them, and has no idea why. The story's insights into this seem limited to the title. There is a killer inside him. The killer is not him. He doesn't understand that killer. He has no control over him, and no doubt sincerely regrets the killer's crimes.</p><p>The story is set in west Texas in the early 1950s. Lou Ford, narrating his own story, is a deputy sheriff in a rural town. He still lives in the home where he was raised. In the evenings, he plays classical piano, reads books from his father's library and plays opera recordings.</p><p>His voice, high-pitched but rough, bespeaks innocence. He has a girlfriend named Amy (<a href=#>Kate Hudson</a>). He has the respect and affection of his alcoholic boss, Sheriff Bob Maples (<a href=#>Tom Bower</a>). He is unfailingly calm and pleasant.</p><p>One day, Maples gives him a job: Drive a few miles outside town and have a word with the prostitute Joyce (<a href=#>Jessica Alba</a>). A powerful local developer, Chester Conway (<a href=#>Ned Beatty</a>), is concerned about her influence on his son, Elmer (<a href=#>Jay R. Ferguson</a>). Ford pays the visit, has some words and soon the two of them are urgently having rough sex. Why? Because this is the pulp universe, where a woman may be a prostitute with other men but she finds you irresistible. Female psychology is not the strong point with many pulp writers. Psychology in general is sketchy, based on simplified and half-understood Freudian notions. With Lou Ford, for example, we're given fragmented glimpses of childhood sexual abuse. Not the sort of abuse we've seen before: His mother liked Lou to slap her.</p><p>Indeed, Lou seems to attract women who like to be beaten. One apparently even likes to be nearly killed. The film attempts to account for this no more than it explains Lou's own nature. The best explanation probably is: When you buy a cheap paperback with a lurid cover, these are the sorts of events that will be described inside. In prose, the focus is through the point of view. In the film, we see the violence happening, and the first time it comes as a gut punch, because we're not remotely expecting it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lm565rbHRZqCnq5mZsm65xGZpaWlg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
