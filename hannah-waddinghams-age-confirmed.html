One of the most popular characters on the Apple Plus series was hands-down Rebecca Welton, the initially stern saboteur turned mentor and friend. Played to utter perfection by Hannah Waddingham, the character became a quick crowd favorite, and aided Waddingham in becoming a superstar.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>She was always popular among a certain fanbase, but even Game of Thrones wasn’t enough to earn Waddingham the name recognition she currently boasts. That’s all thanks to Ted Lasso, the show that exposed just how talented the stunning actress really is.</p><h2 id=h-how-old-is-hannah-waddingham data-injectable=false>How old is Hannah Waddingham?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Hannah_Waddingham.jpg><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Waddingham’s clear skill in Ted Lasso, paired with her statuesque beauty <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and timeless appeal</a>, are huge culprits behind her skyrocketing popularity. The stunning actress plays a woman in her middle age, maybe even a bit older, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the delightful series</a>, something that a few viewers found hard to believe.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Sure, Waddingham looks like a mature woman, but the idea that she’s much over 35 feels a bit hard to swallow. That makes the revelation of her real age all the more shocking — would you believe that Waddingham is nearly 50? She rang in 49 in 2023, but barely looks like she’s flirting with 40.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=false>Waddingham is absolutely gorgeous, and the only real tell, when it comes to her age, is her grace and maturity. She does put off a serene sort of wisdom, in television appearance and in roles, making the star’s true age a bit easier to believe. Still, she looks utterly ageless in her television and film appearances, which seems to be part movie magic, part incredible genes, and part Waddingham’s infectious energy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1orrNmp9mr5GZsaq6xqGYpqtdlrSmecKopZ%2BhoqKypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
