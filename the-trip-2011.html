They get into a sort of competition that allows them to compete with their versions of such as <a href=#>Michael Caine</a>, <a href=#>Ian McKellen</a>, <a href=#>Sean Connery</a>, <a href=#>Woody Allen</a> and others. Brydon does a virtuoso impression of Caine's voice evolving from his early days in "The Ipcress File" through decades of whiskey and cigars into its present richness.</p><p>There's an undercurrent of rivalry throughout, based on what Coogan sees as his greater fame, success and talent. What especially bugs him is that he's seen as a comic actor and denied a shot at the heavy duty A-list material he feels he deserves. He also sees himself as more handsome, fitter and successful than Brydon, and from the way he considers his hair in a mirror you'd think he wanted it to look that way.</p><p>Curiously, they give only perfunctory attention to the many meals they eat, although Winterbottom faithfully goes into the kitchens to show each one being prepared. Scallops are featured in at least half the meals. One breakfast centers on black pudding, which I believe is best eaten with the eyes closed.</p><p>Along the way, they visit Lake District sites associated with Wordsworth and Coleridge, quote copiously, and speculate on Coleridge's use of opium. Coogan's reaction shot is priceless when one woman recognizes Brydon but not him. There's an undercurrent: Brydon has a family to return to in a cozy home; Coogan has a son he's distant from and a barren, modern apartment.</p><p>It's a good question how true any of this is. The movie lists no screenwriters, but although it looks like a documentary, it isn't one. Apparently it was edited down from a longer BBC-TV series during which the food was possibly more discussed. At the end we're left with the intriguing question: Would we rather see the same two actors in a regular story?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lpKe2sXmRaWhq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
