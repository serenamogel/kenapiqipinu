"Old Dads," about three middle-aged Los Angeles men who become fathers decades after giving&nbsp;up on the possibility, is that movie.&nbsp;</p><p>Like "F is for Family," the animated Netflix series created by and starring Burr, and like a lot of Burr's early standup before he aged out of griping&nbsp;and became more nuanced,&nbsp;"Old Dads"&nbsp;is two-thirds a satire on "political correctness"—a loaded phrase which, as often practiced in standup, amounts to not being able to say anything at any given moment&nbsp;without encountering consequences. The remaining third&nbsp;is a meandering midlife-crisis&nbsp;buddy movie in which Burr's character Jack Kelly and his two best friends and business partners (<a href=#>Bokeem Woodbine</a>, Bobby&nbsp;Cannavale)&nbsp;find themselves drifting and stumbling through life after selling the vintage sports jersey replica&nbsp;business&nbsp;they founded together.&nbsp;</p><p>After the sale, the&nbsp;partners are kept on staff and made to&nbsp;watch as everyone born before 1988 is fired&nbsp;(a potential age discrimination lawsuit goldmine, though the movie treats it as a fait accompli), then&nbsp;becomes a parody of 21st-century tech bro and new media cliches. The young&nbsp;wannabe-guru boss, Aspin Bell (<a href=#>Miles Robbins</a>), inundates&nbsp;his elders with disruptor culture buzz phrases while building a cult of personality around himself. As if that wasn't enough to drive the combative and self-righteous Kelly into a frothing snit, Kelly and his wife Linda (Kate Aselton) are having difficulty&nbsp;at their son's elite New Age-y private school because Kelly's rooted-in-the-'70s version of parenting keeps clashing with the staff, administrators, and the other parents, a gaggle of soft progressive Yuppies&nbsp;who teach&nbsp;kids to put their emotions and sensitivities over everything and everyone else.</p><p>The "political correctness" part of "Old Dads" plays like a watered-down and somewhat more&nbsp;self-aware equivalent of one of those TV specials that are aimed at political reactionaries and <a href=#>t</a>hat <a href=#>spawned the "triggered" meme</a>. It&nbsp;follows the same playbook as a lot of Los Angeles-based, post-millennium comedy, going for cheap laughs by having characters blurt out inappropriate things at inopportune moments, then having bystander characters (often&nbsp;Linda) cover for the writers by&nbsp;explaining that you simply can't do stuff like that while&nbsp;nudging the audience to feel that the world is cramping the politically incorrect character's style. It's a shame how coddled everyone has become, says "Old Dads."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46oo51llJaxtHnMqK2inV2nsre1xLBka2hiaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
