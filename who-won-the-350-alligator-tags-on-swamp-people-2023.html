The hunters scour the Atchafalaya River Basin located in south-central Louisiana. It’s the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest wetland</a> and swamp in the whole United States, covering about 374,000 acres of cypress swamps, open water, fresh marsh, and bottomland hardwoods.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>The hunting season is about two months, or 60 days. During season 14, hunters competed to win 350 new alligator tags, which are usually handed out in five or ten-year deals.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>This is a huge prize. It’s like getting to play a claw machine for gold bars without having to pay the machine anything, so the stakes are pretty high.</p><h2 id=h-who-won-the-350-alligator-tags-on-swamp-people-season-14 data-injectable=false>Who won the 350 alligator tags on Swamp People season 14?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=457 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>If you know anything about the show, you know that Troy Landry is a star. Born in Louisiana, Landry is a 63-year-old Cajun man who’s been alligator hunting his whole life.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>He’s also well known as one of the deadliest alligator hunters in the area. In season 14, he teams up with the very likable Pickle and they dominate the competition. They ended up winning the 350 alligator tags.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true>Both Ronnie Adams and Anthony Porkchop Williams wanted to win the tags, but they came up short. Jeromy Pruitt and David La Cart were close – they secured the largest gator but unfortunately they didn’t make it back in time.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>It’s really not that surprising that Troy won. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">regularly redeems more tags</a> than his competitors and he also has collected the most in the area.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Swamp People airs on the History Channel and is available to stream online through the network’s website on Hulu in the U.S. with a Hulu Plus subscription.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mrqimXam1pnmSbmdmmZyhtqit06ipZqyRnMBuu81mqrCZnaV6sbHOqaOeZWJlf3R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
