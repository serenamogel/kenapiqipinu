The actor&nbsp;asks a fellow comedian to join him on a ride around town, during which they talk, grab some coffee, talk again, walk/ride/sit some more, talk some more, and so on and so forth. It’s not a complicated premise, but it works well for Crackle, and it’s earned the web series nine whole seasons(!) since its 2012 premiere.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>With nearly 10 seasons under its belt now, it’s apparent that the definition of “comedian” has been rather flexible, with Christoph Waltz joining the show this year alongside Cedric the Entertainer, Kristen Wiig, Lewis Black, the great Norm Macdonald and Bob Einstein, who’s returning after a season 1 appearance.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>Of course, Seinfeld has been mixing it up with comedians and non-comedians for some time now. In addition to appearances by Seth Meyers, Louis C.K., Tina Fey, Chris Rock, Sarah Silverman, Aziz Ansari, Jon Stewart, Amy Schumer, David Letterman, Kevin Hart, Don Rickles, Patton Oswalt and more, Seinfeld has also traveled alongside President Barack Obama.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>There are fancy cars (of course), music (of course), casual conversations (of course), coffee (obviously), cigars, food, jokes and even some off-road adventures to be found in the upcoming season and fans should know exactly what to expect from the series at this point. It’s as cut-and-dry as they come. Nevertheless, it’s always fun to see Seinfeld in his element, and he looks like he’s having a blast on the show.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false><strong>Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</strong> may be as low stakes as TV can get these days, but it’s a consistently entertaining and immensely enjoyable experience all the same. You can check out the newest season when it premieres on January 5th on Crackle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yku8yem6KZnqh6pK3RrGSgnaSptq%2BzjJymn56Vmnq0scCspqdlaWLBs63IpZyrZaCnvK610p6qZqOinsC1sc1mrqKhl2Kwqb7IrKuoqJhixKK407Nm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
