And the fight was waved off within the first round.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>Bones used his superior wrestling and grappling to control the French kickboxing technician, and Jones forced “Bon Gamin” to tap at the 2:04 mark with a guillotine choke.

He took the title from Mauricio “Shogun” Rua at UFC 128 in 2011.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>What followed was Bones’ record-breaking title defense run that saw him beating the likes of Daniel Cormier, Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, Lyoto Machida, Chael Sonnen, and Vitor Belfort from 2011 to early 2015.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>But, because of legal and personal troubles outside of the Octagon, Jones’ fighting career took a backseat. He was stripped of his belt for violating the UFC’s code of conduct in 2015. Later, he was stripped of the interim title in 2016 after testing positive for banned substances.</p><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=187 data-injectable=false>And when he won back the undisputed championship in 2017 by knocking out Cormier, the result was overturned to a no-contest after Jones tested positive for turinabol, an anabolic steroid.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>He eventually returned to his post as the king of the light heavyweights in 2018 by besting Alexander Gustafsson via third-round KO for the vacant belt at UFC 232.
